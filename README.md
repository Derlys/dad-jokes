# App Dad-Jokes API 

This is a simple project because the main goal is to implement the API usage.

I did not focus on styles or other functionalities.

## 💪🏽 What impacted me positively

- It's amazing how services help you delegate the logic contained in each component.

- I discovered that you can learn a concept in a clear way without making a complex web app.

  ## My challenge
  
- There are many ways to use an API, one of the challenges was to choose between them. 

I continue to learn about other ways to use it.
  
  
## What Do you need for run this project

1. Install dependencies. You will only have to do this once.

```
npm install
```
😉 I prefer `yarn`, [here](https://www.aluracursos.com/blog/npm-vs-yarn) is an article for you to decide.

2. ng serve for localhost

## Build
- Run `ng build` to build the project.
- The build artifacts will be stored in the `/` directory.
- Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
- Remember that I used [this API](https://www.dadjokes.io/)
- For deployment to user to used "VERCEL"
