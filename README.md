# App web use API Dad-Jokes

This is a simple project because the main goal is to implement the API usage.

I did not focus on styles or other functionalities.

## 💪🏽 What impacted me positively

- The evolution of web application is the same as my learning.

- Every learning of a new style framework, a new concept or a new version of Angular is reflected here. I started with Angular V8.
- The refactoring and the order it started with is currently very different. Leaving learnings about clean code, application architecture, design and more.

  ## My challenge
- Learn new syntax in style frameworks.

- The decision of where to host the data changed more than 3 times between Firebase, my own backend application that was more of a manager, and finally my own project that used Markdown.

- For server side rendering, I first had my domain and used "good daddy" and then switched to Cloudflare because it was free.

- Making the routes work was a task that involved more than 10 prototypes.

- I solved the functionality of displaying a certain amount of post on the home page with this service.
